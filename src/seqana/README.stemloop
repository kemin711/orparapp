stemloop algorithm output files:

1. output file given on command line or automatically constructed by the
   program *.slp
	-- this file contains the exact decition by the algorithm. It is useful to
	analyze the problems of this program or data. It slows down the algorithm by
	10x, and we are still leaving it.  When the algorithm is mature enough we
	will remove it.

2. refDoubleHitdcount.tab
  Contains the exact stem loop where the top/bottom sequences are differnt and
  both match to library sequences. This file will be useful in helping the
  design of better libraries.

3. stemloop.summary
  Contain counts in different caetgories.
  alnboth: alighment to both left and right flank sequence with identity above
	        the identity cut of such as 72% 
  alnleft: sequence did not have any sequence identity to the right flank.
  alnright: only align to right flank but not left flank. There should be very
            few of this kind, and they more likely to be caused by realy bizar
				behaviors of the sequencing machine, such as jumping to a different
				cell. Too much of this kind is bad.
  junk: barbage sequence
  tooshort: matched at least one flank, and the total hairpin sequence is
	         shorter than the stem. The 5A's at the end of left flank in the
				version 2 design is very bad for this.  We will have large number
				of this kind because the quality of the reads drop dramatically
				after 3 or more A or T's.
  total sequences: is the total input sequences.
  match2: is the number of unique combination of two matches.
  match2Sum: is the total number of stemloops matching two library sequences.
       One pair of matching-2's may have more than one count.
  match: total number of library sequences matched.
  matchSum: total number of hits to the library. This number divided by match
       is the coverage of the library. For exampl 3395915/35649 in on run has a
		 coverage of the library 95x on average.
  nomatch: the number of library sequences that does not match any stemloop sequence.
  nomatchInput: number of unique input stemloop that does not match any library
       sequences. Either synthesis of sequencing error could have caused the
		 existence of this category.  469671
  nomatchInputSum: total number of stemloop count. This number is printed as a
       negative number to distinguish it from the matchsum. One stemloop in
		 nonmatchInput may have multiple counts. The coverage of this category
		 should be lower than the match category.  For example,
		 -862,618/469,671=1.8 is much lower than 95. The coverage is propertional
		 to the sequencing error and synthesis rates.
  match_miss1 35853
  matchSum_miss1 3644482
  nomatch_miss1  number of library sequences that did not match any input
	    sequence after running the mismatch algorithm
  nomatchInput_miss1 number of unique input sequences that did not match library
       sequence.
  nomatchInputSum_miss1   -614051

4. refcount.tab
	The exact count for libarary sequence (positive) and novel input sequence
	not in library (negative number)

5. refcount_miss1.tab
	Sequences that are different from a library sequence by one nucleotide are
	considered as 'true' hits.  Kind of better cheating a little bit.
	These are caused mainly by sequencing error or synthesis error.

6. numhits_distribution.tab
   Number of hits and count.  Negative number is for non-library sequences.
	This distribution should be extreme-value distribution and should be double
	exponential distribution.

7. insertlencomplete.tab
   insert length (hairpin length after removing flanking regions) distribution.
	The 48 nt length should be the peak. This is the design length of the
	hairping library.  We tend to have more 47 than 48 nt, which could be caused
	by the tendency of Ion Torrent sequencing platform to under count. There are
	some seconary peaks after 48 nt, such as 85, 94 (<2*48), 146 (> 3x48).
	A few negative number are due to deleteion in the flanking sequences. The
	sequence probably went through some recombination or rearrangement.

8. insertlenpartial.tab
  Insert length for partial sequences that has only one of the flanks.
  5 nt is the peak, indicating difficulty sequencing through the hairping
  structure.

9. QCInfo.tab
  This file contains the left, right, and stem, identity, then stem length,
  followed by count.  This is a multiple dimention count from different
  factors. This table contains the information about how the sequence reaction
  has proceeded through the stem.

============ total 55,771 library sequences ===========

Out of toal 55,771 library sequences, 11,860 had no match, 43,911 of library
sequence matched to 2,033,551 input sequences that is 53% of decent sequences. 
The coverage for the mapped sequence is 46.3x.


There are 40 stem-loop that had different sequences for the top and bottom
half, and mapped to two different library sequences.  This indicates the short
distance for a few library sequences.  This is a small number. 

There are 367,564 unique input sequences (representing 567,492 total sequences)
that are not mapped to any library sequence.  The coverage of this unmapped
input sequence is only 1.5x, which indicate their random nature.  If we count
one mis-match to library sequence as match (this feature is not implemented in
the program yet), then about 5-10% more library sequence will also map. 


Output Files:

refcount.tab 
	two columns:
	library_or_input_sequence    count

Negative numbers for counts are for number of times the input sequence occurs in
the experiment and there is no match to the library sequence.
Zero means that the library sequence was not found in this project.
Positive number means the number of times this library sequence was found in
the experiment.

The refDoubleHitcount.tab file contains stemloop sequences that are different
between the top and bottom sequence of the stem-loop (usually by one base). The
count is the number of time this occurs.  This could reflect the systematic
error by the Ion Torrent technology when sequecing the bottom and top strands
of the same sequence. Or it could be random error arriving from PCR, synthesis,
etc.
