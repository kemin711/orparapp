cpfasqpart can do random sampling.

Only edit the *.pl file.
The make file will automatically generate * file from the *.pl file with a
suffix rule.

This will make the perl interpreter more flexibily configured during install
time.

splitfasta

usage: splitfasta -s [size of directory, default=4000] infile in fasta format

This directory contains simple programs to format sequence files. 
Normally, I should use the emboss package to deal with sequences of different
format.  Sometimes user may simply copy and paste a single line of sequence
into the file and call it fasta sequence.  Most computer programs will work
with this, but it is hard for human to look at.
