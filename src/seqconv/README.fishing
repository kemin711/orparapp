For using fishing


Interested in a region in Bar5

First looking at the alignment between the reference and the assembly
at position 1899 there are 8 T in the reference and 11 T in the assembly.

I run the following command

fishing -i bar5.fastq -s GCCCATTCTCCGCCCCATGGCTGACTAATTTTTTTTATTTATGCAGAGGCCGAGGCCGCCTCT -p 29 -r T -n 8 

The Options for this program:
   -i inputFastQfileName  This is the fastq sequence files for this particular plasmid.
	   All the sequences for this plasmid are here.

	-s siteOfInterest   This is the sequence for the site that we are interested.
	   Normally you will need 15-18 nt on either side of the site of interest. In this case
		out site is flanked by realy strange sequences with not only direct repeats but also
		a lots of C and Gs, so we chose a longer size.

	-p [ --repeat-start ] arg             Repeat start in site, 1-based index
	    This is the position where the Poly T starts.  It is 1-based index.
       This option and -r -n will tell this program to do the counting of 
       different number of repeats.  These three options have to be given
       together.  If not given, the counting will not be done.

   -r [ --repeat-base ] arg              Base in the repeat
	     RepeatBase  The base that is repeated.  There is some redundancy here. This is used to
	     make sure we don't make a mistake in counting.

   -n [ --repeat-count ] arg             Number of repeats
	    Is the number of T in the repeat.

	-f [ --outfile1 ] arg                 file for alignments in the forward 
														direction
	-b [ --outfile2 ] arg                 file for alignments in the backward 
														direction
	-o [ --outfile ] arg                  file for storing matched fastq 
														sequences
	-s [ --site ] arg                     The ambiguous site sequence. A length 
														of 35-45 works the best. A good 
														example: CGGGCAAGAGCAACTCGGTCGCCGCATACA
														CTATTCTCAGAATGAC
	-y [ --identity-cutoff ] arg (=0.879999995)
														The sequence identity bewtween site and
														target sequence above which target will
														be processed. A fraction (0-1].
	-l [ --alnlen-cutoff ] arg (=16)      The length of the alignment between the
														cut-site and target sequence above 
														which target will be processed.
	-c [ --cov-cutoff ] arg (=0.699999988)
                                        The coverage of the site.


Our result:

It is clear that there should be 9 T, but for some reason 11 T has the highest count.

In my experience, you see a pattern of N-1 has the highest count, and N count is higher than N-2
and both N and N-2 are lower than N-1.  11T does not show this pattern and thus must be
produced by some strange artifact.
